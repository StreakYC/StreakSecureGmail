# StreakSecureGmail

On August 31, 2018, the Secure Gmail Chrome extension was discontinued and no longer available to download due to Gmail launching a similar feature called Confidential Mode.
We highly encourage you to transition to this new Gmail feature as soon as possible to ensure you can continue sending confidential emails. You should also uninstall the Secure Gmail extension, which will only offer decryption support from now on.

Looking forward, the Streak team will continue to focus on improving our core product - the [Streak CRM for Gmail](https://www.streak.com). It offers workflow management but also power tools like email tracking, scheduled emails, and mail merge all from within Gmail.

## Installation instructions

If you find yourself needing to access a previously-encrypted message and no longer have the Secure Gmail extension installed, here's how you can go about getting the extension back on chrome:

1. Download the source code for the extension by clicking the green "Clone or download" button above.  Click the "Download ZIP" option.
